Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm passionate about coding, open-source projects, and creating cool stuff.

## About Me

I have a fascination with the number π (pi).

The mathematical constant π (pi) is approximately 3.14159 and represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction, and its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.

Here's a fun math challenge for you:

## Math Challenge

What is the area of a circle with a diameter of 10 units? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)

Good luck with the challenge!
